Give me a C++ template with:
- Problem statement as a comment at the top
- No approach or solution explained
- A clean function with only the signature and empty logic
- A sample main() function to call and print the result
- Always use #include <bits/stdc++.h>

Give me a C++ program with:
- Problem statement as a comment at the top
- Clearly explained in detail smultiple approaches if exist (Brute Force, Better, Optimal) 
- Provide time and space complexity for each step of algo and give total time complexity.
- You can also improve my approach if anything wrong(if i have provided). 
- Focus heavily on the thought process behind the optimal approach, explaining the logic and why itâ€™s efficient.
- Write the thought process behind the algo first then write the algo/optimal Approach.
- Clean and complete code implementations for each approach
- Provide clean and complete code implementations for each approach, with readable variable names, consistent formatting, and  inline comments explaining key logic.
- A sample main() function to test all approaches
- All approaches grouped together just below the question
-  All solutions grouped together below the approaches
- Write in code format my file is .cpp
